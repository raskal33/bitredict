# Pool Creation Demo Video Script

## Introduction (Before Starting)

"Today I'll demonstrate how to create a prediction pool on Bitredict. This platform uses a unique contrarian strategy where creators bet AGAINST their own predictions. If you think something is unlikely to happen, you stake money against it. If you're right and it doesn't happen, you win. If you're wrong and it does happen, bettors who disagreed with you win your stake. This allows creators to monetize  their views."

## Step 1: Navigate to Pool Creation

**Action:** Click "Create Market" button

**Script:**
"First, I'll navigate to the pool creation page. Here we can see the three-step process: Category Selection, Market Details, and Deploy."

---

## Step 2: Category Selection

**Action:** Select "Football" category

**Script:**
"I'm selecting Football as the category. This will show me available fixtures from various leagues that I can create a market about."

---

## Step 3: Select Fixture

**Action:** Search and select a specific match (e.g., "Manchester United vs Liverpool")

**Script:**
"Now I'll search for a specific match. Let me select Manchester United versus Liverpool. This fixture shows all the available markets I can create - moneyline, over/under goals, both teams to score, and more."

---

## Step 4: Choose Market Type

**Action:** Select a market type (e.g., "Over 2.5 Goals")

**Script:**
"I'll choose 'Over 2.5 Goals' as my market. This means I'm predicting that the match will have more than 2.5 goals scored. But remember, as a creator using the contrarian strategy, I'm actually betting AGAINST this happening."

---

## Step 5: Set Creator's Stance

**Action:** Select "YES" or "NO" for the outcome

**Script:**
"Here's where the contrarian logic comes in. I'm selecting 'YES' - meaning I believe Over 2.5 Goals WON'T happen. I'm staking my money against this outcome. If the match ends with 2 goals or less, I win. If it ends with 3 or more goals, bettors who place bets - buys, win my stake."

---

## Step 6: Set Odds

**Action:** Enter odds (e.g., 2.50x)

**Script:**
"I'll set the odds at 2.50x. Higher odds mean I'm more confident the outcome won't happen. This determines how much bettors can win if they're right and I'm wrong. The odds also determine the maximum amount bettors can stake against me."

---

## Step 7: Set Creator Stake

**Action:** Enter stake amount (e.g., 100 STT)

**Script:**
"Now I'll set my creator stake at 100 STT. This is the amount I'm risking. If I'm wrong and Over 2.5 Goals happens, bettors will share this stake proportionally based on their bets."

---

## Step 8: Configure Pool Settings

**Action:** Set max bet per user, event times, optional boost tier

**Script:**
"I can set a maximum bet per user to limit individual exposure, configure when betting closes and when the event ends, and optionally add a boost tier to increase pool visibility."

---

## Step 9: Review Summary

**Action:** Click "Next" to go to preview/deploy step

**Script:**
"Let me review the summary. Here I can see all the details: the match, my contrarian stance, the odds, my stake, and the cost breakdown including the 1 STT creation fee. Everything looks correct."

---

## Step 10: Deploy to Blockchain

**Action:** Click "Deploy Market" button

**Script:**
"Now I'll deploy this pool to the blockchain. This will trigger an onchain transaction that creates the pool contract. I need to approve the transaction in my wallet."

**Action:** Approve transaction in wallet

**Script:**
"I'm approving the transaction. This will pay the creation fee and lock my stake into the pool contract."

---

## Step 11: Transaction Confirmation

**Action:** Wait for transaction confirmation

**Script:**
"The transaction is being confirmed on the blockchain. Once confirmed, the pool will be live and visible to all users. Bettors can now challenge my contrarian view by betting that Over 2.5 Goals WILL happen."

---

## Step 12: Success Page

**Action:** View success page

**Script:**
"Perfect! The pool has been created successfully. I can see the transaction hash, and the pool is now live. I can view it in the markets page, or share it with others who might want to bet against my position."

---

## Key Points to Emphasize

**Contrarian Strategy:**
- "Remember, as a creator, you're betting AGAINST your prediction"
- "You win when your predicted outcome does NOT happen"
- "Bettors win when they disagree with you and the outcome DOES happen"

**Onchain Process:**
- "The pool is created as a smart contract on the blockchain"
- "Your stake is locked in the contract until resolution"
- "All transactions are transparent and immutable"

**Creator Benefits:**
- "You monetize your contrarian opinions"
- "You set the odds based on your confidence level"
- "You can attract liquidity providers to join your side"

## Closing

**Script:**
"That's how pool creation works on Bitredict. The contrarian model allows creators to profit from their unique perspectives while giving bettors opportunities to challenge those views. Thanks for watching!"
